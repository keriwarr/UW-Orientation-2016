Schedule
========
The *Schedules* application provides up-to-date access as to what is going on for Math Orientation during the week; faculty events, cross-campus
events and social events going on during the week.  It allows for flipping between a Rain plan schedule or a Sunny plan schedule on the fly as
well as updating the schedule at any time.
