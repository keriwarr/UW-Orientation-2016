Scoring
=======
The *Scoring* application is to be available in the Website and to the mobile applications via an API.  It allows Black-Tie leaders, MODs, Tie Guard,
and MathFOC to submit scoring for events and award arbitrary points to teams.  This allows for a convenient tracking of team points and live updating
of the current standing of the teams.  This should make final scoring at the end of the week significantly easier.  To accommodate accountability and
reduce inconsistency, the application permits limiting who has access to scoring for a particular event and recording of who submitted a particular score.
